# RabbitDotNETCore
Hello Friend! In this repository I'll create a simple service with RabbitMQ using dotNET Core, feel free to explore my simple example!



## How to start

Let's start with a simple docker command in this project

`docker-compose up`

It will start rabbitMQ image in the container (you need a docker installed on your machine), the next step is just to start RProduce to send message in "queue_productos" and  then RConsumer  to receive a message from the queue.

Don't forget that it's a simple example to start rabbitMQ



For more information about RabbitMQ, you can access [RabbitMQ document](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html). ;)
